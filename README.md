### 1.create a new .go file

> example: classfile.go

I will create a new `classfile.go` file

The file needs to include the following code:

code 1:
```go
// Indicates that this is a GOP package
var (
	GopPackage = true
)
```
code 2:
```go
/*
app: It is used to receive the structural variables of your current gox (automatically generated by gop to create new (structural))

lss.Gopt_App_Main(new(home))

(interface{ MainEntry() }).MainEntry(): This function will call the function generated by gop, which will be in the gop_autogen.go file
*/
func Gopt_App_Main(app interface{...}) {
	...
	app.(interface{ MainEntry() }).MainEntry()
}
```
about：Gopt_`App`_Main(`app interface{...}`)

This function must be defined in this way, which belongs to your gox entry. The 'App' corresponds to the App of the structure and the App of gop.mod, as follows：
```go
type App struct {
	xxx
}
```
```gop.mod
gop 1.1

project _lss.gox App github.com/liuscraft/lss
```
### 2.create a gop.mod file

> example: gop.mod

The file needs to include the following code:

```gop.mod
gop 1.1

project _lss.gox App github.com/liuscraft/lss
```

important: `project <_xxx.gox or .xxx> <your Gopt_xxx_Main:xxx> <your module>`
